    <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>
You can pay by any of the methods listed in our checkout screen. Please make sure that if your order is placed using a credit or debit card, the card is valid on the date of your order placement. The Restaurant may provide no refunds to the orders paid online. We request you to contact us directly to settle any payment dispute or refund claim. In addition, please note that if you order on-line, the price charged may be different to the price for the Products had they been ordered in-store or by telephone.
<br>
The online order once placed cannot be modified or cancelled either through the website or offline by calling the restaurant. Anyhow, if you wish to cancel or complain about your order, please call your local restaurant service location, details of which will be included in the confirmatory e-mail sent to you upon placing your order and we shall try our best to help you.
<br>
We will aim to provide you with your ordered products as close as possible to your requested delivery/collection time but we cannot guarantee the delivery time in all the cases. Delivery time may be affected due to bad weather or traffic conditions. This is to ensure the safety of our riders. Delivery service may be temporarily unavailable in selected areas due to bad weather or unforeseen circumstances.
<br>
The Client agrees to accept delivery of the Products at the agreed time and place of delivery. If you have chosen for the Products to be delivered, the Restaurant will deliver the order to the main entrance of the delivery address but any deliveries carried into the delivery address will only be made if the driver and you consent to this. If you are not present to take delivery of the goods at the address given in your order, then we shall not refund you the price for your order and will have to charge you for the full amount of your order.</p>
